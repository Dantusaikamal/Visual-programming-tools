# Visual-programming-tools
A curated list of best Visual programming tools which are not only open-souced, but are also free software! 


## 1. Gutenberg 


According to the official website of Gutenberg, "Gutenberg" is a codename for a whole new paradigm in WordPress site building and publishing, that aims to revolutionize the entire publishing experience as much as Gutenberg did the printed word. Right now, the project is in the second phase of a four-phase process that will touch every piece of WordPress -- Editing, Customization (which includes Full Site Editing, Block Patterns, Block Directory and Block based themes), Collaboration, and Multilingual -- and is focused on a new editing experience, the block editor. 

In my opinion, Gutenberg is a tool that not only helps web developement become more accessible to everyone, but also saves a huge amount of time. If you are interested in creating your own blog where you can write articles, Gutenberg is the perfect choice since you can focus more on writing articles than choosing the right libraries and frameworks, spending time on writing code and the debugging the code. 

Check out [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) for live demo.

## 2. Apache Superset 

Apache Superset is an open-source software cloud-native application for data exploration and data visualization able to handle data at petabyte scale. The application started as a hack-a-thon project by Maxime Beauchemin while working at Airbnb and entered the Apache Incubator program in 2017.

It is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple line charts to highly detailed geospatial charts.

Superset can Quickly and easily integrate and explore your data, using either our simple no-code viz builder or state of the art SQL IDE. 

Superset ships with a wide array of beautiful visualizations. Our visualization plug-in architecture makes it easy to build custom visualizations that drop directly into Superset. 

Check out [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) for more info.
